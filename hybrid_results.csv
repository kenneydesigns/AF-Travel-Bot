How do I appeal a denied HHG claim?,"Yes, a U.S. Service member can appeal a denied HHG claim by submitting a written appeal to their commanding officer within 30 days of receiving the denial letter. The appeal should include specific details of the denial, such as the reason for the denial and any evidence supporting the claim. The appeal should be supported by relevant medical records and other relevant evidence. The commanding officer will review the appeal and make a decision on whether to approve or deny the claim. The final decision rests with the commanding officer and may be appealed to the next higher authority if the original appeal was denied. The written appeal should clearly state the grounds for appeal and the expected timeline for resolution."
