{"chunk_id": "DAFI_00_chunk0", "section_title": "Chapter 2", "metadata": {"chapter": "Unknown", "section": "00"}, "chunk_index": 0, "text": "MANAGING THE LEAVE PROGRAM 2.1. Military Leave Program. 2.1.1. Annual Leave Program. Annual leave programs give members the opportunity to take leave within the constraints of operational requirements. Unit commanders establish these programs to encourage the use of leave for the maximum benefit of the member. Scheduling leave prevents loss of leave at fiscal year-end balancing, retirement, or separation from active duty. Both management and members share responsibility in managing leave balances throughout the fiscal year. 2.1.2. Safe Travel Guidelines. Members on leave or on other non-duty status should use Risk Management principles to assess all hazards and control risks prior to excessive or hazardous travel. Applicable guidelines are in DAFI 90-802, Risk Management. A comprehensive risk management assessment may conclude that fatigue or road conditions are high risks requiring a change to travel plans. 2.1.3. Use of Leave. The use of leave is essential to the morale and motivation of members and for maintaining maximum effectiveness. Lengthy respites from the work environment tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual\u2019s psychological and physical status. Weekend absences (regular pass) or short periods of leave do not normally afford a similar degree of relief. In providing leave, Congress intended for members to use their leave as it accrues. Congress provides for payment of accrued leave when members are unable to use their leave because of military necessity. However, Congress did not intend for members to accrue large leave balances expressly for payment of accrued leave. All members should have the opportunity to take at least one leave period of 14 consecutive days or more every fiscal year and are encouraged to use the 30 days accrued each fiscal year. Supervisors and commanders should encourage members to use leave, military requirements permitting, and consider the desires of the member. 2.2. Leave Approval Authority. While commanders have final approval authority, they may delegate approval authority according to the organization\u2019s needs. Normally, commanders delegate approval authority for annual leave requests to a level no lower than the first-line supervisor. 2.3. Leave Disapproval Authority. Leave is a right; however, unit commanders can disapprove leave requests due to military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force or Space Force (for USSF personnel). Unit commanders may delegate disapproval authority to a level no lower than first-line supervisors. Commanders may adjust delegation of authority based on mission requirements. 2.4. Leave Accrual. 10 USC \u00a7 701, Entitlement and Accumulation governs leave accrual and accumulation. 2.4.1. Accrual. Members accrue 2.5 days of leave for each month of active duty, or 0.5 days for every 6 days of active duty. See Table 2.1 below. 2.4.2. Accumulation. Members may not carry leave in excess of 60 days into the next FY. (T-0) At the end of the fiscal year (FY), members lose leave in excess of 60 days unless 10 DAFI36-3003 7 AUGUST 2024 eligible for SLA.

See Chapter 6 for SLA provisions. 2.4.3. Payment for Accrued Leave. 37 USC \u00a7 501, Payments for Unused Accrued Leave, is the authority for payment for accrued leave upon reenlistment, retirement, separation under honorable conditions, or death. It limits payment of accrued leave to 60 days in a military career effective 10 February 1976. (T-0) A military career includes former service in enlisted or officer status. Members should contact the local financial services office for detailed information on payment of accrued leave. 2.4.3.1. An additional payment for accrued leave is authorized for enlisted service members when they would lose accumulated leave in excess of 90 days. Members may exercise this option once and may sell up to 30 days of SLA. (T-0) Such a sell back counts towards the service member\u2019s cap of 60 days over a career. (T-0) 2.4.3.2. DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, Military Pay Policy \u2013 Active Duty and Reserve Pay, Table 35-1 outlines when members may carry leave forward or receive payment for accrued leave when separating with or without immediate reentry on active duty. Members should contact the local financial services office for detailed information on payment of accrued leave. 2.4.4. Non-Accrual. Members do not accrue leave in the following circumstances: 2.4.4.1. Absence without leave. 2.4.4.2. Unauthorized leave. 2.4.4.3. Confinement as a result of a sentence of a court-martial. 2.4.4.4.

Leave Awaiting Orders as a Result of Disability Proceedings. Charge leave as accrued and accruing when the commander sends a member home or to another location in a permanent change of station status to await orders for disability separation. Charge any remaining time as an authorized absence after the member uses all accrued leave. See DAFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement and Separation for additional information. 2.6. Holidays. Public holidays established by federal statute are non-working days, military operations permitting. When a holiday falls on a Saturday, the non-working day is the preceding Friday. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, the non-working day is the following Monday. Holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized period of leave. If departure on a period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is a day of leave. If return from an authorized period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is not a day of leave. Commanders may be as liberal as training, mission, and local conditions permit in authorizing leave during the Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day period. 2.7. Miscellaneous Information. 2.7.1. Leave for Enforcement of Child Support Obligation. Unit commanders approve leave requested to attend hearings to determine paternity or to determine an obligation to provide child support. (T-3) Unit commanders may disapprove such leave requests if the member is serving in or with a unit deployed in a contingency operation, or exigencies of the military service require a denial of such request. See DAFI 36-2906, Personal Financial Responsibility for further guidance. 2.7.2. Temporary Duty (TDY) from Leave Status. A member ordered TDY while on leave reverts to duty status as of the TDY effective date. 2.7.3. Recall from Leave. Unit commanders may recall members from leave for military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force or Space Force (for USSF personnel). When recalling a member, do not charge the period of absence as leave when the period between departure on leave and the member\u2019s receipt of recall is 3 days or less. Consider the remaining time of absence as travel time, unless the unit commander determines it is clearly excessive to the circumstances. If determined excessive, charge the entire period of absence as leave. (T-3) 2.7.3.1. Refer to the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), paragraph 033301, Leave or Personal Travel Combined with Official Travel, to determine whether travel and transportation allowances apply. If so, member reverts to duty status the day travel to the permanent or TDY station begins. 2.7.3.2. If the unit commander authorizes the member to resume leave after the member completes the duty that resulted in recall, prepare a new DAF Form 988.

When a member is unable to return to duty from leave because of illness or injury: 2.7.5.1. The member should advise the leave approving authority by the quickest means. (T-3) 2.7.5.2. The next of kin, attending military or civilian physician, nearest MTF, or American Red Cross may act on the member\u2019s behalf when incapacitated to such a degree that the member is unable to make the notification. 2.7.5.3. Upon return from leave, the member presents a statement from the nearest MTF or the attending physician regarding the individual\u2019s medical condition. The unit commander evaluates the statement before authenticating the leave document. (T-3) 2.7.5.4. The unit commander may consult with the local MTF or American Red Cross providers for clarification or recommendation. 2.7.5.5. Unit commander issues amended leave authorization, if required. 2.7.6. Medical, Dental, Hospitalized or Placed on Quarters. 2.7.6.1. Medical or Dental Care. When a member on leave requires medical or dental care, he or she reports to the nearest MTF. If treated at civilian facilities, member is authorized medical and dental treatment at government expense only for emergency and immediate non-emergency care. 2.7.6.2.

When a member has taken all the advance leave that he or she can accrue during the remaining period of active service, unit commanders change member\u2019s leave status from advance to excess leave. Enlisted members carry forward advance leave to a new period of service if they separate and immediately reenlist 3 or more months before expiration of the term of service. 3.2.2.6. Advance Leave and Excess Leave. When authorizing excess leave in conjunction with advance leave, advance leave does not accrue during the period of excess leave involved. Example: A member with an Expiration of Term of Service of 15 March 2023 requests 30 days leave effective 1 October 2022. The member has 2 days accrued leave through 30 September 2022. The member would normally accrue 14 days during the period 1 October 2022 - 15 March 2023. Therefore, the member would have a total of 16 DAFI36-3003 7 AUGUST 2024 19 days accrued and tentative advance leave through expiration of Term of Service. The tentative excess leave period is 14 days (30 days requested leave minus 16 days accrued and tentative leave). The member will not accrue 1.5 days during the tentative excess leave period. Therefore, reduce the 14 days leave that would normally accrue by 1.5 days that will not accrue during the excess leave period (See Table 4.5.). This results in advance leave of 12.5 days. In this example, the authorized leave is 2 days accrued leave, 12.5 days advance leave, and 15.5 days excess leave. 3.2.2.7. Indebtedness. The financial services office stops or collects, if applicable, all pay and allowances paid after a member\u2019s leave status changes from advance to excess leave.

Unit commanders approve initial emergency leave periods up to 30 days and extensions up to another 30 days.

Regular and Special Pass Information. A pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short time. Note: For an extension beyond the authorized pass period, a service member shall be charged leave for the entire period if the absence exceeds 3 days and is deemed unauthorized and avoidable. (T-0) For unavoidable circumstances, a service member will be charged leave only for those days beyond the authorized pass period. (T-0) 5.2. Regular Pass. 5.2.1. A regular pass (liberty) is the period between the end of the duty day and the beginning of the next duty day. It normally begins at the end of the workday day on Friday afternoon until the beginning of the workday the following Monday when Saturday and Sunday are non- duty days (days off). (T-0) 5.2.2. A regular pass period (non-duty days) for units on non-traditional work schedules (alternate or compressed work schedules) may not exceed the 4-day special pass limitation. The combination of non-duty days and a public holiday may not exceed the 4-day special pass limitation. (T-0) The combination of 3 non-duty days and a public holiday during a compressed work schedule is a regular pass period. 5.3. Special Pass. Unit commanders may award 3- or 4-day special passes for special occasions or circumstances, such as reenlistment or for some type of special recognition or compensatory time off. They may delegate approval to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents. (T-1) Special passes start after normal working hours on a given day.

{"chunk_id": "DAFI_00_chunk0", "section_title": "Chapter 6", "metadata": {"chapter": "Unknown", "section": "00"}, "chunk_index": 0, "text": "SPECIAL LEAVE ACCRUAL 6.1. Overview. This chapter describes the SLA provisions when deployments or assignments to a hostile-fire or imminent-danger pay area prohibit members from using leave. SLA also applies when deployments or assignments to designated operational missions at the national level prohibit members from using leave. It provides information on restoring leave lost at the end of the fiscal year, when permitted by Congress. 6.2. SLA Eligibility. 6.2.1. Leave in Excess of 60 Days at the End of the Fiscal Year. SLA allows members assigned to hostile fire/imminent danger pay areas for 120 consecutive days or who are otherwise assigned to qualifying duties in an operational mission, as designated by Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), to accumulate leave in excess of 60 days. Furthermore, it should be a result of the member\u2019s inability to take leave or to reduce their leave balance to 60 days before the end of the fiscal year while being assigned to said activities. (T-0) 6.2.2. Members assigned to a non-hostile fire pay and/or non-imminent danger pay area in support of an operational mission who are on Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment orders (and in rare cases, Department of Defense Form (DD Form) 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel orders) are authorized to retain such leave up to 90 days until the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the leave was lost. (T-0) Example: A deployment to Qatar or UAE may qualify a member for SLA under this paragraph since they are non-hostile fire and/or non-imminent danger pay locations at the time of this publication. (T-1) 6.2.3. Members eligible for (or approved for) SLA are authorized to retain such leave (not to exceed 90 days) until the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which SLA was lost. (T-0) 6.2.4. SLA must not be used as a means to authorize the accumulation of leave in excess of 60 days that is a result of members\u2019 failure to properly manage their leave balance. (T-1) 6.2.5. The situation preventing members from using leave must have been caused by a catastrophe, national emergency and/or crisis, or operations in defense of national security. 6.2.6. The member\u2019s support of an operational mission in defense of national security for 120 or more consecutive days, whether in a hostile fire or imminent danger area or not, will not automatically qualify a member for SLA. (T-1) 6.2.7. SLA Transition. A service member with a total leave balance of 90.5 or greater on 31 December 2022, may carry forward into FY24 no more than 60 days of ordinary leave and no more than the number of days of SLA leave the service member had on 31 December 2022.

The original date of expiration of the SLA leave will remain unchanged except the portion of SLA leave days that exceed 30 days which will expire no later than 30 September 2026, if not used on or before that date. (T-0) Example: On 31 December 2022, a service member had a total leave balance of 107.5 days, 47.5 of which were SLA leave days (30 of the 40 days of SLA were approved in FY21 with an original expiration date of 30 September 2024, 10 days DAFI36-3003 7 AUGUST 2024 63 were approved in FY22 with an original expiration date of 30 September 2025 and 7.5 were approved as SLA in FY23). Assuming the member used 22.5 days of leave from 1 January 2023 through 30 September 2023, 17.5 days will expire on 30 September 2026 if not used by that date. 6.3. SLA Not Authorized. Members are ineligible for SLA when the following precludes using leave (this list is not all-inclusive): 6.3.1. Normal permanent change of station moves and TDY. 6.3.2. Base closures. 6.3.3. Hospitalizations, aeromedical evacuations, quarters, and convalescent leaves. 6.3.4. Details and special working groups. 6.3.5. Attending training exercises, schools or courses, unless they are required for the deployment that resulted in the loss of leave. 6.3.6. Pending separations and retirements. 6.3.7. Workload after return from deployment. 6.3.8. Post-deployment recovery time. 6.3.9. Post deployment/mobilization respite absence. 6.3.10. On alert status. 6.4. Calculating SLA Lost on 1 October. 6.4.1. The maximum amount of SLA leave that may be carried forward is the leave balance at the end of the fiscal year following the end of the SLA qualifying period, not to exceed 90 days. (T-1) 6.4.2. The maximum amount will be reduced to a new level whenever the leave balance drops below the previously set level. If, at any time, the leave balance drops to or goes below 60 days, then there is no longer any SLA protected leave. Therefore, the actual maximum leave that can be carried forward into succeeding fiscal years is the lowest leave balance achieved following the completion of the SLA duty or the usual 60 days, whichever is greater. (T-1) 6.4.3. If the SLA qualifying period crosses a fiscal year, then the entire leave balance (not to exceed 90 days) will be carried forward and the leave accrued from the beginning of the new fiscal year through the end of the SLA qualifying period will be added to establish the maximum. Only that portion of a leave balance in excess of 60 days that could not have been taken before the end of the fiscal year because the member was assigned to SLA-qualifying duty will be included in the carryover amount. Example: On 31 August 2023, a member had a leave balance of 80 days. On 15 September 2023, he was assigned to duty qualifying for SLA.

Example: On 31 August 2023, a member had a leave balance of 80 days. On 15 September 2023, he was assigned to duty qualifying for SLA. Had the member not been assigned to SLA duty, he could have possibly taken 15 days leave from 16 September through 30 September. If the member had taken leave during this period, then there would still have been a loss of 7.5 days (82.5 days accrued through 30 September, less the 15 days potentially taken and the normal 60-day carryover restriction) at the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, since only the portion that potentially could have been taken is protected, the member may carry forward 75 days and will lose 7.5 days of leave. (T-1) 64 DAFI36-3003 7 AUGUST 2024 6.5. SLA Approval Authority. For eligible members, the first O-7 in the chain of command will be the final approval authority for SLA requests. At other organizations (e.g., Air Staff, MAJCOM, FOA, DRU) the senior officer representative (O-7 and above) or equivalent at the directorate level approves SLA for his/her organization. At joint organizations, the senior Air Force or Space Force (for USSF personnel) officer representative on staff approves SLA for eligible members assigned to units, HAF, and supporting staffs. (T-0) 6.5.1. Prior to approving a request for SLA, commanders must assess whether a member has used all means to reduce their leave balance by looking at the entire fiscal year, including the time period prior to and after the event that drove the SLA request. (T-1) 6.5.2. Once the SLA package receives approval, the package is sent to AFPC to validate if the request meets the criteria outlined in paragraphs 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 and then on for processing. 6.6. SLA Disapproval. Any commander in the chain of command may deny a member\u2019s request for SLA without referring it to a higher-level authority when the member\u2019s request does not meet the criteria for SLA consideration. 6.7. Exceptions To Policy (ETP). Members who believe they are eligible but do not meet the criteria in paragraphs 6.2.1 \u2013 6.2.2 may submit an ETP. Reasons for lost leave should have DAF- or DoD-wide significance. These exceptions will be considered on a case-by case basis and the approval authority resides at AF/A1 or SF/A1 (for USSF personnel). (T-1) Example 1: Service member was selected to lead an investigation, major project or program that prevented them from taking ordinary leave. Example 2: Service member was preparing for retirement and the Air Force requested/directed the member to extend their service commitment. Example 3: The installation was impacted by a natural disaster requiring base personnel to assist with recovery actions thus preventing the use of leave. 6.8. Members not eligible for SLA. Members not eligible for SLA, for the reasons listed in paragraph 6.3 can request recovery of days lost by submitting a DD Form 149 to the Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR).

See DAFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. Applications must clearly establish that an error or injustice by the Air Force or Space Force (for USSF personnel) caused the member\u2019s lost leave. If the Board restores leave to current leave account, members must use these days before the end of the current FY. (T-1) Refer to Personnel Services Delivery Guide (PSDG) for processing procedures. 6.9. Submitting SLA Requests. Refer to the Leave PSDG located on myFSS for processing procedures. 6.10. Last In, First Out Leave Accounting. Leave will be accounted for by crediting it sequentially in the chronological order in which it is accrued. Generally, when used, leave will be charged with the most recently accrued leave charged first. This method is known as Last In, First Out. As an exception, Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) leave will be charged first, regardless of when it was earned. (T-0) Example: If a service member had 70 days of leave as of 1 Oct 23 and took 10 days of leave from 1 - 10 Dec 23; they would have earned 5 days of leave which would put their leave balance at 75 as of 1 Dec 23. Since they\u2019ve only earned 5 days (Last In/First Out), those days would be reduced from their 30 days balance, while the other 5 days would come from their SLA balance leaving them with 25 days of use of lose.

Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT). COT refers to members stationed OCONUS who are ordered to a consecutive overseas assignment at the same duty station, or are reassigned/PCS to another overseas duty station. Service members and dependents on a COT may be paid travel and transportation allowances in connection with authorized leave after completing the initial tour if remaining at the same duty station or while transitioning to the new OCONUS duty station. Members and dependents may travel together or independently, and all travel must be completed before end of the second OCONUS tour. (T-0) 7.2. In-Place Consecutive Overseas Tour (IPCOT). IPCOT refers to members assigned to a consecutive tour at the same overseas duty station. Members cannot initiate the travel until they have entered the new IPCOT tour and have until the end of the IPCOT tour to use the travel and transportation allowances. Otherwise, the authority expires. (T-0) The leave taken is ordinary leave charged based on authorized allowable travel. See paragraph 7.4.3 for exception to the end of tour limitation when members are unable to use the travel due to duty in connection with a contingency operation. 7.3. Deferred COT. Deferred COT refers to members unable to use the COT leave travel and transportation allowances between the two tours because of military necessity, or when requested by member and approved by the commander and placed in the permanent change of station orders. Members have until the end of their new tour to use the COT leave travel and transportation allowances, otherwise, the authority expires. (T-0) The leave taken is ordinary leave charged based on authorized allowable travel time. See paragraph 7.4.3 for exception to the end of tour limitation when members are unable to use the travel due to duty in connection with a contingency operation. 7.3.1. If the member takes 11 days or more en route, the COT leave travel entitlement has been used. Note: The number of non-COT leave days the member may take en route is limited to 10 days. Members who had their COT leave travel entitlement deferred but exceeded the 10-day leave limitation may request a review of their circumstances. (T-1) 7.3.2.

Members have until the end of their new tour to use the COT leave travel and transportation allowances. Otherwise, the allowance expires. (T-0) 7.4.3. Exception to End of Tour Limitation. Members unable to use the authority before completing the new tour due to duty in connection with contingency operations may defer travel until not more than 1 year after the completion of the duties precluding travel. In this case, the member is still authorized to leave travel from the new Permanent Duty Station (i.e., the permanent duty station after departure from the OCONUS location from which deferred travel could not be taken) to an authorized location. The cost limitation for travel from this new permanent duty station and return is the cost from the permanent duty station from which deferred travel could not be taken to the home of record and return. The cost limitations are established in the JTR. Note: The additional deferment based solely on duty performed in connection with a contingency operation is a one-time additional authority and cannot be further extended. If members do not qualify for an extension based on duty in connection with a contingency operation, they may submit a DD Form 149. See DAFI 36-2603. Member\u2019s application must establish that an error or injustice by the Air Force or Space Force (for USSF personnel) prevented the member from using the authority within the specified time frame.

Carryover Leave Usage (See Total Force PSDG, Military Leave Program on myFSS). 7.9.1.1. Members will not be placed on orders for the sole purpose of using carryover leave. (T-3) 7.9.1.2. Members must obtain their gaining commander\u2019s approval for carryover leave usage prior to issuance of orders. (T-3) The commander\u2019s approval must include validation of resource availability, to include Operations and Maintenance funding, if appropriate. (T-3) Members who wish to take carryover leave during a tour must contact their finance office for verification documentation (e.g., Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Defense Joint Military Pay System, previous orders) reflecting the member\u2019s previous leave balance(s). (T-3) DAFI36-3003 7 AUGUST 2024 69 7.9.1.3. If the gaining commander approves, the carryover leave days will be included as part of the overall tour length and carryover leave will be taken during that tour. (T-3) Example for RC only: RC member agrees to a 60-day tour and asks to use 10 days of carryover leave. Commander approves an overall 70-day tour length that includes authorized travel, duty time, annual leave accrued during the tour (5 days) and the 10 days of carryover leave. 7.9.1.4. The gaining commander has discretion to approve and cancel approved leave if mission or circumstances (e.g., disciplinary actions) dictate. 7.9.1.5. If the request that led to approved leave is withdrawn by the member, or the commander cancels previously approved carryover leave, the unused carryover leave is credited back to the member\u2019s leave balance and tour length adjusted. 7.9.1.6. When a member does not take leave during a tour of duty and chooses not to sell it, this leave may be carried forward to a future active-duty long tour. 7.9.1.7. ARC AGR orders will not be extended to account for carryover leave. (T-1) 7.9.2. Carryover Leave Limitations. 7.9.2.1. Members will not take carryover leave in conjunction with an annual tour. (T-1) 7.9.2.2. Members cannot use carryover leave to justify entering sanctuary for the purpose of an active duty retirement. (T-1) 7.9.2.3. Members may not carry more than 60 days of leave from one fiscal year to the next unless authorized SLA (See Chapter 6). (T-0) 7.9.2.4. Members transferring from the RegAF to the ARC may carry over their leave for use during a future active duty tour. 7.9.2.4.1. RegAF leave cannot be used when a service member transfers to an ARC Traditional Reservist, Air Reserve Technician, Individual Reservist, ANG Technician, or Drill Status Guardsman position until they are put into an active duty status.

Leave earned in one active duty status may be authorized and taken in a different active duty status funded by a distinct and different appropriation to include AGR, statutory tour, or ADOS. 7.9.3.3. When a member has a leave balance at the end of the tour and does not elect to carry it forward utilizing a 1089 prior to the orders end date, that leave will be sold and paid to the member.

Note: Exceptions to the 60-Day career leave payment limitation can be found in DoD 7000.14, Volume 7A, Chapter 35. 7.10. RC OCONUS Leave En route. While downtime is generally observed prior to leave, a commander has the discretion to approve deployed leave en route (or leave in conjunction with temporary duty performed in an overseas location) and allow downtime to occur upon return from leave. As force providers to Air Force MAJCOMs, ANG units and members must comply with both supported MAJCOM and Combatant Command leave en route policies and procedures. (T-3) 7.10.1. Post-deployment OCONUS leave en route must be requested and approved by the first General Officer in the member\u2019s home station chain of command and deployed commander prior to departure.

Purpose. The PDMRA is established for members who are required to mobilize or deploy with a frequency beyond established rotation goals. The yearly rotation goal consists of a deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:2 years for AC personnel and 1:5 years for the RC. That is, for every 1 year an AC service member is deployed, member requires 2 years at the home station; and for every 1 year a RC service member is deployed, member requires 5 years at the home station. This policy applies to all members with creditable deployments and mobilizations underway on, or commencing after, 1 October 2011. PDMRA is a type of administrative absence. Note: Guidance for PDMRA on or after 19 January 2007, but before 1 October 2011 can be found in the Personnel Services Delivery Guide, Military Leave Program on myFSS. 8.2. Creditable Time for AC. Regular DAF personnel who, on the first day of their current deployment, deployed in excess of 12 months out of the previous 36 months, and who meet the other eligibility criteria contained in this instruction, qualify for PDMRA days. Example: If a regular DAF service member cumulative deployments of 30 consecutive days or longer and is more than 12 months out of the previous 36 months, the member is eligible to accrue PDMRA if deployed to a location authorized for PDMRA accrual. 8.3. Creditable Time for RC. RC Airmen who, on the first day of their current qualifying mobilization/deployment, mobilized pursuant to 10 USC \u00a7 12301(a), Reserve Components Generally, 10 USC \u00a7 12302, Ready Reserve \u2013 The Under Secretary of Defense, or 10 USC \u00a7 12304, Selected Reserve and Certain Individual Ready Reserve Members; Order to Active Duty other than During War or National Emergency in excess of 12 months out of the previous 72 months, and who meet the other eligibility criteria contained in this enclosure, qualify for PDMRA days. In addition, voluntary deployments on 10 USC \u00a7 12301(d) orders to a CZTE area will be used for determining creditable time for PDMRA accrual. (T-0) 8.4. PDMRA Accrual Rates. PDMRA begins to accrue when a member has boots on ground for 30 consecutive days and is provided for each month or fraction of a month beyond 30 consecutive days. PDMRA days cannot be carried forward or rolled over to a new deployment or mobilization period. 8.4.1. Two Administrative Days Per Month. (See Figure 8.1.) 8.4.1.1. Regular DAF personnel accrue 2 administrative absence days per month when exceeding the deployment threshold in paragraph 8.2 of this DAFI and the Airman is entitled to CZTE for deployment to a combat zone. Creditable time starts when the Airman has boots on ground at the CZTE location (the same day they become eligible for CZTE. 8.4.1.2.
