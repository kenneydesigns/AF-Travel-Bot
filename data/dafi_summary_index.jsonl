Safe Travel Guidelines:\n- Members on leave or on other non-duity status should use Risk Management principles to assess all hazards and control risk prior to excessive or hazardous travel.\n- Applicable guidelines are in DA", "content": "MANAGING THE LEAVE PROGRAM 2.1. Military Leave Program. 2.1.1. Annual Leave Program. Annual leave programs give members the opportunity to take leave within the constraints of operational requirements. Unit commanders establish these programs to encourage the use of leave for the maximum benefit of the member. Scheduling leave prevents loss of leave at fiscal year-end balancing, retirement, or separation from active duty. Both management and members share responsibility in managing leave balances throughout the fiscal year. 2.1.2. Safe Travel Guidelines. Members on leave or on other non-duty status should use Risk Management principles to assess all hazards and control risks prior to excessive or hazardous travel. Applicable guidelines are in DAFI 90-802, Risk Management. A comprehensive risk management assessment may conclude that fatigue or road conditions are high risks requiring a change to travel plans. 2.1.3. Use of Leave. The use of leave is essential to the morale and motivation of members and for maintaining maximum effectiveness. Lengthy respites from the work environment tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual\u2019s psychological and physical status. Weekend absences (regular pass) or short periods of leave do not normally afford a similar degree of relief. In providing leave, Congress intended for members to use their leave as it accrues. Congress provides for payment of accrued leave when members are unable to use their leave because of military necessity. However, Congress did not intend for members to accrue large leave balances expressly for payment of accrued leave. All members should have the opportunity to take at least one leave period of 14 consecutive days or more every fiscal year and are encouraged to use the 30 days accrued each fiscal year. Supervisors and commanders should encourage members to use leave, military requirements permitting, and consider the desires of the member. 2.2. Leave Approval Authority. While commanders have final approval authority, they may delegate approval authority according to the organization\u2019s needs. Normally, commanders delegate approval authority for annual leave requests to a level no lower than the first-line supervisor. 2.3. Leave Disapproval Authority. Leave is a right; however, unit commanders can disapprove leave requests due to military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force or Space Force (for USSF personnel). Unit commanders may delegate disapproval authority to a level no lower than first-line supervisors. Commanders may adjust delegation of authority based on mission requirements. 2.4. Leave Accrual. 10 USC \u00a7 701, Entitlement and Accumulation governs leave accrual and accumulation. 2.4.1. Accrual. Members accrue 2.5 days of leave for each month of active duty, or 0.5 days for every 6 days of active duty. See Table 2.1 below. 2.4.2. Accumulation. Members may not carry leave in excess of 60 days into the next FY. (T-0) At the end of the fiscal year (FY), members lose leave in excess of 60 days unless 10 DAFI36-3003 7 AUGUST 2024 eligible for SLA.

See Chapter 6 for SLA provisions. 2.4.3. Payment for Accrued Leave. 37 USC \u00a7 501, Payments for Unused Accrued Leave, is the authority for payment for accrued leave upon reenlistment, retirement, separation under honorable conditions, or death. It limits payment of accrued leave to 60 days in a military career effective 10 February 1976. (T-0) A military career includes former service in enlisted or officer status. Members should contact the local financial services office for detailed information on payment of accrued leave. 2.4.3.1. An additional payment for accrued leave is authorized for enlisted service members when they would lose accumulated leave in excess of 90 days.

Public holidays established by federal statute are non-working days, military operations permitting. When a holiday falls on a Saturday, the non-working day is the preceding Friday. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, the non-working day is the following Monday. Holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized period of leave. If departure on a period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is a day of leave. If return from an authorized period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is not a day of leave. Commanders may be as liberal as training, mission, and local conditions permit in authorizing leave during the Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day period. 2.7. Miscellaneous Information. 2.7.1. Leave for Enforcement of Child Support Obligation. Unit commanders approve leave requested to attend hearings to determine paternity or to determine an obligation to provide child support.

When recalling a member, do not charge the period of absence as leave when the period between departure on leave and the member\u2019s receipt of recall is 3 days or less.

(T-3) the advance leave for 3.2.2.5. Advance Leave Becomes Excess Leave. When a member has taken all the advance leave that he or she can accrue during the remaining period of active service, unit commanders change member\u2019s leave status from advance to excess leave. Enlisted members carry forward advance leave to a new period of service if they separate and immediately reenlist 3 or more months before expiration of the term of service. 3.2.2.6. Advance Leave and Excess Leave. When authorizing excess leave in conjunction with advance leave, advance leave does not accrue during the period of excess leave involved. Example: A member with an Expiration of Term of Service of 15 March 2023 requests 30 days leave effective 1 October 2022. The member has 2 days accrued leave through 30 September 2022. The member would normally accrue 14 days during the period 1 October 2022 - 15 March 2023. Therefore, the member would have a total of 16 DAFI36-3003 7 AUGUST 2024 19 days accrued and tentative advance leave through expiration of Term of Service. The tentative excess leave period is 14 days (30 days requested leave minus 16 days accrued and tentative leave). The member will not accrue 1.5 days during the tentative excess leave period. Therefore, reduce the 14 days leave that would normally accrue by 1.5 days that will not accrue during the excess leave period (See Table 4.5.). This results in advance leave of 12.5 days. In this example, the authorized leave is 2 days accrued leave, 12.5 days advance leave, and 15.5 days excess leave. 3.2.2.7. Indebtedness.

Emergency Leave of Absence (Non-Chargeable Leave). Unit/squadron commanders or civilian directors may grant a service member non-chargeable emergency leave of absence for a qualifying emergency with the following limitations. This authority cannot be further delegated to a subordinate level: 4.2.6.1. The commander or director must verify the qualifying emergency to his or her satisfaction based upon information or opinion from a source other than the service member that the commander or director considers to be objective and reliable.

It provides information on restoring leave lost at the end of the fiscal year, when permitted by Congress. 6.2. SLA Eligibility. 6.2.1. Leave in Excess of 60 Days at the End of the Fiscal Year. SLA allows members assigned to hostile fire/imminent danger pay areas for 120 consecutive days or who are otherwise assigned to qualifying duties in an operational mission, as designated by Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), to accumulate leave in excess of 60 days.

The maximum amount will be reduced to a new level whenever the leave balance drops below the previously set level. If, at any time, the leave balance drops to or goes below 60 days, then there is no longer any SLA protected leave.

If the SLA qualifying period crosses a fiscal year, then the entire leave balance (not to exceed 90 days) will be carried forward and the leave accrued from the beginning of the new fiscal year through the end of the SLA qualifying period will be added to establish the maximum. Only that portion of a leave balance in excess of 60 days that could not have been taken before the end of the fiscal year because the member was assigned to SLA-qualifying duty will be included in the carryover amount.

Last In, First Out Leave Accounting. Leave will be accounted for by crediting it sequentially in the chronological order in which it is accrued. Generally, when used, leave will be charged with the most recently accrued leave charged first. This method is known as Last In, First Out. As an exception, Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) leave will be charged first, regardless of when it was earned.

Since they\u2019ve only earned 5 days (Last In/First Out), those days would be reduced from their 30 days balance, while the other 5 days would come from their SLA balance leaving them with 25 days of use of lose.

The PDMRA is established for members who are required to mobilize or deploy with a frequency beyond established rotation goals. The yearly rotation goal consists of a deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:2 years for AC personnel and 1:5 years for the RC. That is, for every 1 year an AC service member is deployed, member requires 2 years at the home station; and for every 1 year a RC service member is deployed, member requires 5 years at the home station. This policy applies to all members with creditable deployments and mobilizations underway on, or commencing after, 1 October 2011. PDMRA is a type of administrative absence. Note: Guidance for PDMRA on or after 19 January 2007, but before 1 October 2011 can be found in the Personnel Services Delivery Guide, Military Leave Program on myFSS. 8.2. Creditable Time for AC. Regular DAF personnel who, on the first day of their current deployment, deployed in excess of 12 months out of the previous 36 months, and who meet the other eligibility criteria contained in this instruction, qualify for PDMRA days. Example: If a regular DAF service member cumulative deployments of 30 consecutive days or longer and is more than 12 months out of the previous 36 months, the member is eligible to accrue PDMRA if deployed to a location authorized for PDMRA accrual. 8.3. Creditable Time for RC.

In addition, voluntary deployments on 10 USC \u00a7 12301(d) orders to a CZTE area will be used for determining creditable time for PDMRA accrual. (T-0) 8.4. PDMRA Accrual Rates. PDMRA begins to accrue when a member has boots on ground for 30 consecutive days and is provided for each month or fraction of a month beyond 30 consecutive days. PDMRA days cannot be carried forward or rolled over to a new deployment or mobilization period. 8.4.1. Two Administrative Days Per Month. (See Figure 8.1.) 8.4.1.1.
