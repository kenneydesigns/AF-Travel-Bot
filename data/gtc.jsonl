DoD policy is that the GTCC will be used by all DoD personnel (military or civilian) to pay for all costs related to official government travel. See Section 0406 for exemptions to mandatory use. Official government travel is defined as travel under official orders while performing duties pertaining to official government assignments such as temporary duty (TDY) and permanent change of station (PCS). The purpose of the GTCC is to serve as the primary payment method for official travel expenses incurred by DoD personnel (military or civilian). Refer to the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), for information on authorized travel expenses. Use of the card for expenses not authorized by the JTR is prohibited. Refer to the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998 (TTRA), Public Law (Pub. L.) 105 264, for additional information regarding mandatory use of the travel card. Benefits of the GTCC Program include, but are not limited to, the following: A. Increases data capture, provides business intelligence to improve travel programs, reduce overall travel costs and expand strategic sourcing opportunities and collection B. C. D. E. F. Improves audit readiness and program management Reduces the need (and costs to the DoD) for travel advances, reconciliation Eliminates the need for travelers to pay for expenses with personal funds Improves financial readiness and financial security of travelers Increases rebates from the GTCC vendor (see Section 040306)"}

For additional information see Section 041005. *Blue text with dotted underline denotes new or updated guidance 5 Government Travel Charge Card Regulations Revised April 9, 2025 A. Commanders and/or Supervisors should ensure Agency Program Coordinators (APCs) provide monthly reports identifying GTCC delinquencies, personal use, misuse, abuse, or fraud. Some examples of misuse uncovered by Inspector General (IG) audits include using the GTCC to pay for adult entertainment, gambling, any expenses for other than the cardholder (except for authorized expenses for dependents when on PCS, permanent duty-related travel, or authorized designated child care provider transportation expenses as outlined in JTR section 050108), and excessive Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals for amounts exceeding authorized meals and incidental expense amounts. Particular attention should be focused on those cardholders with a history of previously reported personal use, misuse, abuse, or fraud. Commanders/Supervisors/APCs should strongly consider temporarily blocking from use or restricting card active start and end dates for both standard and restricted accounts when not in an official travel status for cardholders with a history of misuse (including delinquency). APCs should immediately report any additional GTCC personal use, misuse, abuse, or fraud to the Commander or Supervisor. Commanders or Supervisors should consider whether available personnel assistance programs or corrective action would be beneficial when GTCC personal misuse, abuse, or fraud is identified related to gambling, financial or other concerns. B. Military personnel who violate the specific prohibitions contained in Section 041005 can be prosecuted under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for failure to obey a lawful order or regulation, as well as any other applicable article of the UCMJ, based on the nature of the misconduct involved. In each case of improper, fraudulent, abusive, or negligent use of the GTCC by military personnel, including any use at establishments or for purposes that are inconsistent with the official business of DoD or with applicable standards of conduct (such as adult entertainment or gambling establishments), the commander and/or supervisor of the responsible individual or parties will be informed by the APC in a timely manner in order that appropriate corrective or disciplinary action may be taken. The intent of this policy is to ensure that management emphasis is given to the importance of supervisors carefully considering all of the facts and circumstances in reaching a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair. Actions available when military personnel misuse the GTCC include counseling, supplemental training on DoD GTCC policy, recertifying their GTCC Statement of Understanding (SOU), admonishment, reprimand, non-judicial punishment (Article 15, UCMJ), court-martial, and administrative separation.

In taking corrective or disciplinary action against military personnel who misuse the GTCC, commanders or supervisors must use the procedures established for each action by the appropriate Military Department and consult with their legal advisors as necessary. In addition to corrective or disciplinary action, military personnel who misuse their GTCC may have their access to classified information modified or revoked if warranted in the interests of national security. Commanders or supervisors must ensure that security clearance reviews are conducted when the cardholder comes under investigation for GTCC misuse. Additionally, each Military Department must have a regulation providing that a violation of any of the rules governing the use of the GTCC by a person subject to the UCMJ is punishable as a violation of Article 92, UCMJ, at minimum. C. Civilian personnel who misuse or abuse the GTCC may be subject to appropriate administrative action such as written or verbal counseling, recertifying their GTCC SOU, and requiring supplemental training on DoD GTCC policy or disciplinary action up to and including removal from Federal service. It is DoD policy that improper, fraudulent, abusive, or *Blue text with dotted underline denotes new or updated guidance 6 Government Travel Charge Card Regulations Revised April 9, 2025 negligent use of a GTCC is prohibited. This includes any use of a GTCC at establishments or for purposes that are inconsistent with conducting official government travel or business of the DoD or with applicable regulations (such as adult entertainment or gambling establishments). DoD Components must take action to implement GTCC disciplinary guidance for civilian employees as necessary. Components must advise the DTMO of any additional administrative or disciplinary action against civilian personnel for personal use, misuse, abuse, or fraud of the GTCC or any recommended legislation your Component considers necessary to effectively take disciplinary action against DoD civilian employees for improper, fraudulent, or abusive use of GTCC. DoD policy requires supervisors who receive information indicating that a civilian employee has engaged in any misuse of a GTCC to take appropriate action as soon as practicable, including an investigation if warranted. The supervisor of the responsible individual(s) must be informed by the APC as soon as possible so that appropriate corrective or disciplinary/adverse action may be taken.

Coordination with the appropriate legal office must occur early in the process, as required by Component policy. The review of the security clearance (or the modification or revocation of such security clearances in light of this review) of the individual involved in GTCC misuse or abuse cases is not a disciplinary action and must not be treated as such.

These actions are the result of ignorance, carelessness, or both while lacking intent. Abuse \u2013 Intentional or willful misuse of the government-issued charge card in violation of applicable regulations. Willful misuse of the GTCC by DoD personnel (military or civilian) may constitute a crime punishable under Federal (Title 18, U.S. Code) or State law. Internal Fraud \u2013 Any felonious (criminal) act of corruption or attempt to cheat the Government or corrupt the Government\u2019s agents by cardholders or charge card program officials. Internal fraud is the use of the charge card to transact business that is not sanctioned, not authorized, not in one\u2019s official Government capacity, not for the purpose for which the card was issued, or not as part of official Government business.

Standard GTCC. Standard cards are issued to individuals with a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score above 659. The credit, cash, and retail limits will be as described in Annex 1. Standard accounts are issued in an open status and are available for use upon verification of receipt of the card and setting up a PIN. The APC, CPM, or DTMO have the authority to increase the limits temporarily, as needed to meet mission requirements. Commanders or supervisors must validate the requirement to increase the limit. Limits are raised temporarily, not to exceed 12 months, and can be accomplished within the GTCC vendor\u2019s EAS or by contacting the GTCC vendor. Approval authority/limits within the DoD are communicated to the GTCC vendor through the DTMO. Commanders or supervisors may, through their APCs, decrease the available cash and credit limits based on mission needs. B. Restricted Travel Card. Restricted cards are issued to individuals with a FICO credit score below 660 or those who do not consent to a credit score check.

CBAs are issued to make travel arrangements and must be used in lieu of issuing an Optional Form (OF) 1169, Government Transportation Request, for payment purposes. CBAs are a government liability; therefore, payments are subject to 31 USC 1801 (Public Law 97-177), the \u201cPrompt Payment Act of 1982,\u201d as amended. Prompt Pay Act information can be obtained at the US Department of Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service\u2019s website. These accounts contain a unique prefix that identifies the account as a CBA for official Federal Government travel. This prefix also identifies the account as eligible for government travel rates, including GSA City Pair Program rates and tax exemption. The APC must forward any request to establish a CBA or increase a credit limit to the appropriate CPM for approval. The CPMs will also ensure annual reviews are performed to monitor credit limits and card utilization. CBAs are issued for the following purposes: A. Transportation Accounts. Transportation CBA travel card accounts are issued to DoD activities for use in purchasing transportation, including airline tickets, bus tickets, and rail tickets. Due to the additional costs to the DoD of maintaining and reconciling CBAs, DoD restricts CBA transportation accounts use to the purchases of air, rail, and bus tickets ONLY for travelers who have not been issued an IBA. These purchases are made through a Travel Management Company (TMC) directly with the travel service provider or their agent (e.g., charter bus or air companies). The transportation office, or other designated DoD activity, receives and is responsible for reconciling the transportation charges appearing on the invoice and for verifying/certifying the invoices for payment. The transportation office, or other designated DoD activity, will forward verified/certified invoices to the designated entitlement office (i.e., vendor pay) for computation and subsequent transmittal to the designated disbursement office. This will be completed in a manner that allows payment to be made within the 30-day limitation prescribed in the \u201cPrompt Payment Act\u201d thus avoiding any interest penalties. B. Unit Travel Charge Cards. DoD Components may use unit travel charge cards for group travel requirements (including meals, lodging, and other travel related expenses) only when it is cost effective, in the best interest of the mission, and authorized by the CPM. Unit cards may not be used to circumvent required procurement/contracting activities and cannot be used for mission related expenses. Components will limit the issuance of unit GTCC cards whenever possible and maximize the use of IBAs.

Cardholders are responsible for reconciling their GTCC account against claimed travel expenses, taking action to avoid erroneous or improper payments, and minimizing credit balances on their account. B. Long Term Travel. For travel greater than 45 days, the traveler will file interim vouchers every 30 days in order to receive partial payments and will use split disbursement as the means of settlement to ensure payment to the GTCC vendor to avoid delinquency.

Disputed Charges. In the event that the billing statement includes charges that the account holder considers questionable, the cardholder will first contact the merchant to try to resolve the questionable charge. If unsuccessful, the cardholder will access the EAS to view their bill and dispute it online (see 040303). If the cardholder or CBA manager is unable to dispute the transaction online, they may obtain, complete, and submit a dispute form from the APC or GTCC vendor; however, an online dispute is the preferred process. The cardholder or CBA Manager will complete and send the form to the GTCC vendor. The cardholder can find a Transaction Dispute Guide on the GTCC vendor\u2019s website, under APC Guides. All disputes must be filed within 60 days of the date on the billing statement on which the erroneous charge first appeared. It is the responsibility of the cardholder to ensure the dispute form has been received by the GTCC vendor. Once the dispute notification has been received by the GTCC vendor, the GTCC vendor will issue a provisional credit for the amount of the dispute pending resolution. Formally disputed charges will not age and the account will not suspend for lack of payment, however any undisputed charges should be paid in full. Any disputed charge identified in the reconciliation process will be resolved in the manner prescribed in the GSA SmartPay Master Contract.
