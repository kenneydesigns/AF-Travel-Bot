DoD Components must appoint all DTS users that certify payments as COs. COs certify funds for payment in accordance with the 31 U.S.C. 3325 and DoD FMR, Volume 5. A. COs must meet the qualifications in DoD FMR, Volume 5 and be appointed using DD Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record \u2013 Authorized Signature.

The practice of appointing DAOs to perform any particular function or class of functions is an option available to management/the Command for inclusion in systems of internal controls. A. When considering whether to permit only persons appointed as DAOs to perform duties that generate the information, data, or services that COs rely on, appointing authorities must take into account considerations that include accomplishing mission and functions under their area of responsibility, the availability of resources, the sufficiency of other internal controls, and whether or not a governing policy or directive mandates performance of some function only by a properly appointed DAO (see DoD FMR, Volume 5).
