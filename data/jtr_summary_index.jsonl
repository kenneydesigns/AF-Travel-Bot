For the Armed Forces and NOAA, the GCC is determined by using the \u201cBest Value\u201d methodology for the channel and the actual HHG weight up to the Service member\u2019s authorized maximum HHG weight allowance as follows: a. For shipments within the CONUS, between the CONUS and Alaska, and within Alaska (called domestic shipments), the GCC includes the following \u201cBest Value\u201d charges: (1) Line haul, packing, and unpacking. (2) Line haul factor charges at the origin and destination. (3) Short-haul charges for shipments moving 800 or fewer miles. b. For international shipments, which include shipments to or from Hawaii and to or from U.S. territories and possessions, the GCC includes the \u201cBest Value\u201d \u201cSurface\u201d Single Factor Rate (SFR). c. Payment of accessorial charges may only be authorized or approved when charges would have been authorized during a Government-arranged move and all applicable tariff approval rules have been met.

If the dependent is foreign-born, the travel order may also authorize him or her to travel to a destination in the dependent\u2019s native country. This applies whether the HHG is OCONUS or in NTS. a.

PCS travel and transportation allowances must be paid when it is in the Government\u2019s interest to fill a position by moving a civilian employee from one PDS to another. Case- by-case factors, such as cost-effectiveness, labor market conditions, and difficulty in filling the vacancy, form the basis for determining whether to offer PCS allowances. Budget constraints do not justify denying PCS allowances. B. Responsibilities. It is each DoD Component\u2019s responsibility to make decisions that balance a civilian employee\u2019s rights and the prudent use of appropriated funds. Before a DoD Component advertises for a vacancy, the appropriate official should determine if it is in the Government\u2019s interest to pay PCS allowances taking case-by-case factors into consideration. For example, an activity may determine that well-qualified candidates exist within a particular geographical area and restrict the recruitment area in the recruitment announcement or indicate that PCS allowances are not offered. This information should be provided in the position advertisement, but can be decided after the applicants are referred to the selecting official. C. Reason for Move. The guidelines for making a move in the Government\u2019s best interest are as follows: 1. Management-directed Moves in the Government\u2019s interest. A PCS is in the Government\u2019s best interest when a DoD Component recruits or requests a civilian employee to transfer. This is limited to relocation for a RIF, a transfer of function, a DoD Component career-development program, a DoD Component-directed placement, or another reason that the transfer is in the Government\u2019s interest. 2. PCS Moves not in the Government\u2019s Interest. If a civilian employee pursues, solicits, or requests a position change resulting in a geographic move from one PDS to another, the transfer is for the civilian employee\u2019s convenience and benefit, not in the Government\u2019s interest. In that case, the gaining activity must formally advise the civilian employee, at the time it extends an offer, that the transfer is in the civilian employee\u2019s interest, not in the Government\u2019s interest, and that the Government does not pay the PCS expenses. A civilian employee responding to a vacancy request is not pursuing, soliciting, or requesting a position change. D. Notification. Travel and transportation allowances do not tie automatically to a Merit Promotion Program vacancy announcement. The appropriate official must document any decision against paying PCS allowances in writing. The organization must notify in writing all applicants selected for interview of its decision whether to pay PCS allowances. If the organization does not hold interviews, it 03/01/2025 5F-9 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B must inform the selected applicant, in writing, whether it will pay PCS allowances.", "metrics": {"readability": 0.11960000000000001, "grammar": 1.0, "keyword_coverage": 0.3333333333333333, "confidence": 0.56}}

Lack of family housing in an area OCONUS that prevents dependent travel is an administrative embargo.

For regulations governing excused absence and duty status while preparing for and completing a PCS move, see DoDI 1400.25, Vol. 630 (civilian employee leave). A. Movement between Different Departments and Agencies or DoD Components. This applies to movement between any of the following: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, DoD Components, and to or from non-DoD Agencies. Except in the case of a RIF, transfer of function, or movement under the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP), costs associated with a PCS may be paid by the gaining Department, Agency, or DoD Component. 1. RIF or Transfer of Function. The losing activity must pay transfer costs between different DoD activities of a civilian employee identified for separation or demotion caused by RIF or transfer of function. A losing DoD activity must request that the non-DoD gaining activity pay or share the costs for transfers that involve a RIF or transfer of function to a Department or Agency outside DoD. If a non- DoD gaining activity refuses to assume or share the expense, the losing activity must pay the cost. 2. PPP. PCS costs for movement under the PPP to a different DoD Component, due to a RIF or transfer of function, are funded the same as for any other RIF or transfer of function. When a RIF or transfer of function is not involved and a civilian employee returns to the United States through the PPP from a foreign area assignment the gaining activity pays TQSE and MEA. The losing activity pays other PCS costs. B. Movement within the Same DoD Component. The gaining activity may pay PCS movement costs if the move meets the criteria in par. 053701, except in the following cases: RIF or transfer of function, base realignment and closure (BRAC), from an activity OCONUS to an activity in the CONUS, or from an activity OCONUS to an activity of the same DoD Component in Hawaii. 1. RIF or Transfer of Function. The losing activity must pay movement costs. 2. BRAC. Ordinarily the gaining activity pays PCS movement costs. However, the losing activity may, at its discretion, pay PCS movement costs due to a BRAC action. 3. Transfer from an Activity OCONUS to an Activity in the CONUS.

B. Ineligible Civilian Employees: The following are ineligible for a TCS:\n\n 1. A new appointee\n 2. An individual employed intermittently in the Government service as a consultant or expert", "content": "A. Eligibility. An AO may authorize a TCS with limited PCS allowances, instead of TDY allowances, for a civilian employee scheduled for a long-term TDY not less than 6 months or more than 30 months. An AO may authorize a TCS only when it is expected to last 6 months or more. The TCS location is the civilian employee\u2019s temporary official duty location. If the assignment ends sooner than 6 months, for reasons other than separation from Government service, TCS expenses are paid. If the assignment is more than 30 months, the civilian employee must be permanently assigned to the temporary official location or returned to the previous official location. A TCS assignment may be considered only if the civilian employee is directed to perform a long-term TDY at another duty location outside the local area as defined in section 0206. No minimum distance between a PDS and TCS location is required to qualify for a TCS. A Service agreement is not required for a TCS move. B. Ineligible Civilian Employees.

The AO must determine that TCS is more advantageous than a TDY or PCS, otherwise TDY travel and per diem are payable. 1. Component Cost Considerations. An AO should consider a TCS when a cost comparison shows that a TCS is to the Government\u2019s advantage. The AO should compare the costs for a long-term TDY with per diem and actual expense allowance (AEA) for the entire period of the assignment and the costs for a TCS, which has substantial relocation allowance payments at the beginning and end of the assignment and less substantial payments for extended storage and property management services, if authorized. 03/01/2025 5F-16 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B 2. Civilian Employee Tax Consideration. An AO should consider TCS when a long-term TDY results in a non-reimbursable income tax liability for a civilian employee. A civilian employee who performs a TCS is subject to income tax on some of the TCS reimbursements, and receives a RIT allowance. A civilian employee who performs a TDY for more than 1 year at a single location is subject to income tax on travel reimbursements. A traveler should contact Federal, state, and local authorities concerning potential income tax liability. 3. Civilian Employee Concerns.

HHG. The AO determines the storage location of authorized NTS of HHG, which may be stored for the TCS duration. Together, the total weight of HHG stored and the weight of HHG transported must not be greater than the maximum 18,000 pounds. The civilian employee is personally financially responsible for all excess costs if the total weight of stored and transported HHG is greater than the maximum allowed. b.

Automobile use is to the government\u2019s advantage for first duty station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel. Automobile use by a dependent is to the Government\u2019s advantage for PCS travel, other than transoceanic. B. Privately Owned Motorcycle. The use of a privately owned motorcycle for first duty-station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel, is to the Government\u2019s advantage when travel costs, including associated per diem, are less than commercial transportation. Compare travel costs at the applicable MALT rate, plus per diem for the travel period, limited to the time required to complete the trip at a rate of 350 miles a calendar day. C. Privately Owned Airplane 1. The use of a privately owned airplane for first duty-station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel, is to the Government\u2019s advantage when travel costs, including associated per diem, are less than commercial transportation. Compare travel costs at the applicable MALT rate, plus per diem for the travel period, limited to the time required to complete the trip at a rate of 350 miles a calendar day. 2.

The following expenses are not reimbursable: charges for repairs, depreciation, replacements, grease, oil change, antifreeze, towage, and similar expenses. E. Transoceanic Travel by POV. An AO may authorize a civilian employee or dependent to use a POV on a route normally involving transoceanic travel if it is more advantageous to the Government.

When transoceanic travel is involved between to, from, or between PDSs OCONUS, air transportation is the normally authorized transportation mode for transoceanic travel for both the civilian employee and any dependents. For POV travel, see par. 053802-E. A dependent is required to use Government transportation when it is reasonably available and directed. However, the dependent must not be required to use other than regularly scheduled transport type aircraft, such as Patriot Express or Category B AMC transportation, ordinarily used for passenger service. When appropriate Government air transportation is available and travel by aircraft has not been determined medically inadvisable but a dependent travels at personal expense no reimbursement is authorized. C. Concurrent Travel. Concurrent dependent travel from the CONUS is authorized to specific areas OCONUS (see Table 5-67). For a civilian employee on a PCS order to a dependent-restricted tour, see par. 053704. When prior command approval OCONUS is necessary, the recruiting office in the CONUS or other appropriate office must obtain concurrent travel authority from the command OCONUS and advise the activity responsible for processing the civilian employee. When dependent travel is authorized concurrently with the civilian employee or within 60 days after the civilian employee\u2019s reporting date at the Army, Navy, or Air Force transportation terminal in the CONUS, the activity responsible for processing the civilian employee must take action regarding the dependent\u2019s passport, visas, immunizations or inoculations, port calls, and transportation.

An AO must minimize HHT allowances or not authorize them when other satisfactory and more economical alternatives are available.

If the civilian employee has a large family and must promptly vacate the residence at the old PDS, it might be less costly to the Government, as well as more convenient to the civilian employee, to complete arrangements for a new residence before the move actually takes place. 2.

Inability to locate permanent private-sector housing adequate for family needs due to housing conditions at the new PDS. d. Sudden illness, injury, or death of the civilian employee or of an immediate family member. B. Occupancy Time Frames. The occupancy period for temporary lodging runs concurrently for the civilian employee and all dependents. The civilian employee may occupy temporary lodging at one location while a dependent occupies temporary lodging at another location. If a civilian employee moves HHG into temporary lodging occupied initially at a new PDS and continues occupancy indefinitely, the temporary lodging is considered \u201cpermanent private-sector housing\u201d starting on the date the HHG is delivered. However, the AO may determine it is still \u201ctemporary lodging\u201d after considering lease duration, HHG movement into the lodging, lodging type, expressions of intent, attempts to secure permanent private-sector housing, and how long the civilian employee occupied the lodging. 1. Starting Occupancy. Temporary lodging occupancy may start as soon as the civilian employee has signed a service agreement and TQSE allowances have been authorized in a PCS order. TQSE must begin within 1 year after the civilian employee\u2019s effective date of transfer, unless that time is extended in par. 053712. 2. Occupancy Interruptions a. Once TQSE (LP) begins, the period continuously runs uninterrupted until the civilian employee or any dependent occupies permanent lodging or the authorized time period ends. Events that interrupt the TQSE (LP) continuous period are: (1) Actual travel time for travel between the old PDS and new PDS. (2) Necessary official duties, such as an intervening TDY or military duty. (3) Non-official necessary interruptions, such as hospitalization. (4) Approved sick leave but not annual leave. b. Other reasons beyond the civilian employee\u2019s control interrupt the continuous period if acceptable to the AO. c. When official travel interrupts occupancy of temporary lodging, the actual time en route, limited to the authorized allowable travel time, is excluded from the eligibility period, which resumes when temporary lodging is reoccupied. The time period continues to run if a dependent occupies temporary lodging at the civilian employee\u2019s new PDS, or another location, during the civilian employee\u2019s TDY or military duty training assignment. When a civilian employee retains temporary lodging while on a TDY, the cost is reimbursed as part of the TQSE (LP) allowance (in addition to per diem received for the TDY) if the AO determines that the civilian employee acted reasonably in retaining the temporary lodging. d.

TQSE eligibility continues for the remainder of the authorized time, if necessary. 3. Ending Occupancy. Temporary lodging occupancy ends when the civilian employee or a dependent occupies permanent private-sector housing or the authorized time period expires, whichever occurs first. C. Receipts and Supporting Statement. Receipts and a written supporting statement must accompany a TQSE (LP) claim. Use DD Form 2912, \u201cClaim for Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense (TQSE),\u201d to document TQSE expenses for reimbursement. 1. Receipts. Receipts are required for lodging costs paid and must show the location, dates, and who occupied the lodging. Lodging taxes and other subsistence expenses of $75 or more requires a receipt. There is no requirement to document M&IE. 2. Supporting Statement. The supporting statement must include: a. Travel status and temporary lodging occupancy (for subsistence expense purposes) that occur the same day, the date, and the arrival and departure times at the temporary lodging location. b. The date that permanent private-sector housing occupancy starts or the date that HHG is moved into permanent private-sector housing. c. The amount of lodging paid for each day. D. Conditions Affecting Reimbursement 1. Partial Days of TQSE (LP). Temporary lodging occupancy for less than a whole calendar day is the same as 1 full calendar day for TQSE (LP) reimbursement. 2. En Route Travel. Reimbursement may not be paid under both TQSE (LP) and another subsistence expense allowance within the same calendar day, unless TQSE (LP) is claimed on the same day that en route travel per diem ends. In this case, compute en route travel per diem under applicable partial-day rules and claim TQSE (LP) reimbursement for expenses incurred after 1800 (6 p.m.) on that day. Par. 054205 explains limitations on duplication of allowances. 3. Temporary Lodging Occupancy in All Other Cases. The TQSE (LP) period starts at 0001 of the calendar day that TQSE (LP) reimbursement is claimed, provided temporary lodging is occupied during that calendar day. 4. TQSE (LP) Period Termination. The temporary lodging period ends at 2400 on either the day before the civilian employee or his or her dependents occupies permanent residence quarters, or the day that authorized TQSE expires, whichever occurs first. 5. Meal Preparation in Temporary Lodging. If the temporary lodging has meal-preparation facilities available and those facilities are used, the cost for groceries consumed on a daily basis is allowable. 6. Lodging with a Friend or Relative.

A traveler who lodges with a friend or relative is authorized the appropriate M&IE rate, if otherwise eligible. 7. Allowable Expenses when an Apartment, House, Mobile Home or Recreational Vehicle Is Rented or Used for Lodging a. When a civilian employee on PCS at the old or new PDS rents commercial or private lodging, a furnished or unfurnished apartment, house, mobile home, or recreational vehicle for use as lodging, TQSE (LP) lodging expenses are computed according to par. 020303. Any lodging, apartment, house, or mobile home that is already or will become the PDS permanent residence cannot also be used as a temporary residence. b. To calculate the reimbursement amount, determine the daily TQSE (LP) lodging rate and prorate the total allowable expenses used by the number of TQSE (LP) days used then compare the actual daily TQSE (LP) lodging cost against the locality\u2019s daily lodging rate and pay the lesser amount. 8. Reimbursement Limitation when Purchasing a Mobile Home. TQSE (LP) expenses are limited to the temporary expenses listed in par. 020303 when a mobile home is purchased as a temporary residence and used while seeking a primary residence at the new PDS other than the mobile home being used as temporary lodging. Real estate expenses, such as mortgage or interest fees, are not authorized. If the civilian employee\u2019s primary residence is already or will become the home used as a temporary residence, TQSE is not authorized. 9. HHT and TQSE (LP) a.

When the AO authorizes a time extension of TQSE (LP) for temporary lodging occupancy beyond the first 60 days, the additional days must be computed at the reduced rates as specified in Table 5-85a.

See Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense Lump Sum (TQSE(LS)) Computation for examples of how to calculate a TQSE (LS) payment amount. The AO, not the civilian employee, determines if TQSE is offered and the number of days necessary, limited to 30 days. A. AO Considerations. The following factors must be considered before authorizing TQSE (LS): 1. Ease of Administration. TQSE (LS) does not require the review of claims, receipts, and supporting statements for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount because receipts and supporting statements are not required. The civilian employee is paid before the occupancy of temporary lodging, eliminating the after-the-fact voucher process. 2. Cost. The AO should compare the cost of TQSE (LS) to the cost of TQSE (LP). 3. Civilian Employee Choice. If the AO offers a civilian employee TQSE (LS) option, the civilian employee must choose between TQSE (LS) and TQSE (LP) and the travel order must document that decision. The TQSE (LS) option is only an offer and the civilian employee is not obligated to accept it. A civilian employee may decline the TQSE (LS) offer and choose to be reimbursed by TQSE (LP). B. Payment Limitations 1. Temporary lodging must be occupied for TQSE (LS) to be paid. 2. The civilian employee must sign a statement, which must be included as part of the service agreement, asserting that he or she will occupy temporary lodging and incur TQSE expenses. If temporary lodging is not occupied and no expense was incurred, the civilian employee must return the TQSE (LS) payment. 3. The number of days offered for TQSE (LS) is prospective and must be established in advance. TQSE (LS) cannot be authorized for more than 30 days under any circumstances. 4.

TQSE (LS) is paid for the number of days authorized, not the number of days temporary lodging was occupied. 2. Number of People.

The civilian employee is financially responsible for all excess weight charges associated with shipments heavier than the authorized weight allowance, even if the excess-weight status was known or suspected before transportation and the Transportation Officer did not notify the civilian employee or the AO providing transportation funds of the weight status. Once HHG has arrived at its destination, the Service concerned determines the amount of the extra costs that the civilian employee must pay.

HHG transportation to the civilian employee\u2019s actual residence, wherever located at the time of the assignment OCONUS, may be authorized when a civilian employee located OCONUS is authorized travel and transportation allowances at Government expense for a PCS, separation, or early return of dependent (ERD). a. The advance return transportation of all or any part of a civilian employee\u2019s HHG at Government expense, while the civilian employee remains assigned at a PDS OCONUS, is authorized only in connection with and under the same conditions as an early return of a dependent (ERD). The Government may reimburse the authorized costs of advanced HHG transportation (even if there was no advance return of a dependent) when the civilian employee has earned return travel and transportation allowances and an official PCS order directs the civilian employee\u2019s PCS or separation travel. Reimbursement of the civilian employee\u2019s transportation costs is limited to the Government\u2019s cost to transport the HHG at the time of the civilian employee\u2019s actual return travel. b. Advance HHG transportation at Government expense is not authorized unless the civilian employee has earned eligibility for return transportation by completing an agreed service period or advance return travel has been authorized for the civilian employee\u2019s dependent as being in the Government\u2019s interest. If the civilian employee has not completed an agreed period of service, the civilian employee is financially responsible for the advance HHG transportation.

HHG of a civilian employee returning for separation may be transported at Government expense from the PDS OCONUS, NTS location, or both to the actual residence in the civilian employee\u2019s service agreement. HHG, including PBP&E, transportation may be to any alternate destination, but reimbursement is limited to the Government\u2019s constructed cost of transporting the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence in the civilian employee\u2019s service agreement. This also applies when a civilian employee retires at the PDS OCONUS. The civilian employee is financially responsible for any excess cost. PBP&E transported as an administrative expense to a location OCONUS may be returned as an administrative expense to a civilian employee\u2019s actual residence for a civilian employee separating from Government service. d. During an evacuation, HHG transportation may be authorized at Government expense to the same location designated for a dependent\u2019s evacuation. If it is necessary and practical, HHG may be transported later at Government expense to the evacuated civilian employee\u2019s assigned PDS. 03/01/2025 5F-55 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B B. Items of Extraordinary Value. Items of extraordinary value may be transported by an expedited mode that provides satisfactory service at the \u201cBest Value\u201d to the Government, and may not be counted as unaccompanied baggage. Examples include articles of gold and other precious metals, jewels, valuable art, rare and costly collections, and items of substantial value ordinarily worn or carried, such as cameras and accessories, binoculars, jewelry, including costume jewelry, that are prone to being stolen. Items that are irreplaceable or have extreme financial or sentimental value do not receive special security though the civilian employee may purchase extra-value insurance. The net weight of such shipments is charged against the civilian employee\u2019s weight allowance. C. Reshipment of HHG. HHG returned to the CONUS or the actual residence and then reshipped back to a PDS OCONUS during a continuous employment period OCONUS do not require a new service agreement. The reasons for re-transportation of the same HHG must be beyond the civilian employee\u2019s control and the Headquarters of the DoD Service or Agency concerned must authorize or approve the re-transportation.

HHG transportation from the area OCONUS must begin as soon as practicable after the effective date of the civilian employee\u2019s PCS or return for separation. If practicable, HHG transportation should be concurrent with the civilian employee\u2019s departure or as soon afterward when appropriate transportation becomes available. Under no circumstances can HHG transportation occur later than 1 year after the effective date of a new PDS reassignment, excluding any time that administrative embargoes or shipping restrictions make the transportation impossible. When a civilian employee returns from an assignment OCONUS for separation, the following conditions apply: a. A civilian employee forfeits an HHG transportation allowance, including PBP&E transportation, if he or she does not use it within 1 year after the effective date of the separation. b. Upon a written request from the civilian employee or a surviving dependent, the activity\u2019s commanding officer OCONUS may authorize delayed HHG transportation from the area OCONUS, but a delayed shipment must be transported within 1 year after the effective date of the separation. c. HHG transportation from storage is authorized to the final destination if the shipment is transported within 1 year of the effective date of the civilian employee\u2019s separation. d. SIT of HHG is limited to 90 or fewer days. Upon a civilian employee\u2019s written request, the AO may authorize an additional period limited to 90 or fewer days. See par. 054307 for details on SIT.

Unaccompanied baggage is part of the total HHG weight 03/01/2025 5F-56 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B allowance. The unaccompanied baggage weight allowance is 350 pounds net weight for each adult and dependent age 12 or older and 175 pounds net weight for each child under age 12.

Unaccompanied baggage may be transported by air from the old PDS to the appropriate port of embarkation to arrive before the civilian employee or dependent\u2019s transportation departure time. Unaccompanied baggage may be transported by air when the transportation mode with the lowest \u201cBest Value\u201d cost cannot provide the required service, the civilian employee certifies the unaccompanied baggage is necessary to carry out the assigned duties, or the AO determines that expedited transportation is necessary to prevent undue hardship to the civilian employee or dependent. 2. HHG. The official designated by the Service or Agency must authorize or approve the HHG transportation method. The designated official must complete a cost comparison before authorizing a transportation method on a PCS order. The servicing Personal Property Shipping Office must provide the rate comparison by computing the cost difference between the actual expense and commuted rate methods of HHG transportation to the AO. 3. Actual Expense a. If the Government procures the HHG\u2019s transportation, it contracts, negotiates, audits, and pays the Transportation Service Provider (TSP), carrier, or vendor directly for transportation. The PCS order must state the HHG transportation authority, that the Government will arrange transportation of the HHG, and that unauthorized charges are the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility. Determine the Government-arranged transportation cost using the \u201cBest Value\u201d method in DTR 4500.9- R, Part IV, Chapter 403 (Best Value) for the actual HHG weight transported, limited to the maximum weight allowance. b. If the PCS order states that the Government will arrange transportation of the HHG but the civilian employee personally procures the HHG transportation, then he or she must make the necessary arrangements for the HHG move and pay for the move. Reimbursement is limited to actual expenses incurred by the civilian employee, limited to the \u201cBest Value\u201d cost of a Government-arranged move for the same HHG weight. c. If actual expense HHG transportation is authorized, and the civilian employee transports HHG by Government-procured and personally-procured transportation, the combined HHG shipments cannot exceed the authorized HHG weight allowance and the cost must be lower than that of Government-procured HHG transportation of the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot between authorized places. The same requirements for splitting a shipment apply when a civilian employee moves part of HHG him or herself. 03/01/2025 5F-57 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B 4.

The civilian employee arranges HHG transportation other than by shipping the HHG within a mobile home. The civilian employee is authorized reimbursement under the GSA Commuted Rate for carrier services provided, including transportation, packing, unpacking, crating, drayage, and SIT. Payment under the GSA Commuted Rate is regardless of the actual expenses incurred by the civilian employee. The GSA Commuted Rate used must be in effect on the date the commercial shipper picks up the HHG, or if other than a commercial shipper is used, the date HHG begins movement. The civilian employee must furnish the actual or constructed HHG transportation weight (cubic foot measurement). A civilian employee may receive an advance for HHG transportation and SIT if authorized under the Commuted Rate. The civilian employee may not receive any reimbursement if a third party, such as a new employer, pays for the HHG transportation. 5. Civilian Employee Responsibility. A civilian employee who chooses to personally arrange for HHG transportation, whether by moving the HHG personally or by contracting directly for the HHG move, is entirely responsible for all issues related to the Status of Forces Agreement, use of U.S. carriers, import and export processes, and any tariffs, customs, or other related issues. If Service regulations require, the civilian employee must also give preference to Voluntary Inter-modal Sealift Agreement ship carriers when available. 6. Limitations. The Government will only pay for HHG transportation that is within the civilian employee\u2019s authorized HHG weight allowance. The cost is limited to what the Government would have incurred for transporting the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot between authorized places, when a Government-arranged move is available. All HHG transportation must be made on U.S. flag carriers, when reasonably available. Payment on a commuted-rate basis is not authorized when the civilian employee fails to furnish the actual or constructed (cubic foot measurement) HHG transportation weight. When the civilian employee does not provide the actual or constructed weight, reimbursement is limited to the amount actually paid by the civilian employee, or the commuted-rate amount, whichever is less. The civilian employee must furnish an acceptable estimated weight statement. HHG may not be moved at Government expense when any of the following occur: a. There is no official civilian employee movement, except when the advance return of a dependent from a PDS OCONUS is authorized. b. The civilian employee violates the agreement under which the HHG originally were transported. c. The civilian employee is not authorized transportation at Government expense. d.

NTS of HHG for Duty at an Isolated PDS in the CONUS. A civilian employee who performs PCS travel or new appointee travel to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS is eligible for NTS of HHG. The Transportation Officer determines the NTS location. Justified requests for NTS on a PCS order to a PDS at an isolated location should be submitted to the official designated by the Service or Agency for a decision. 1. Service Agreement. Expenses for NTS of HHG at Government expense may be authorized for a civilian employee transferring to or within the CONUS when the civilian employee agrees, in writing, to remain in Government service for 12 months, beginning the date the civilian employee reports for duty at the new PDS. This requirement may only be waived if the civilian employee is separated for reasons beyond his or her control that are acceptable to the Service or Agency concerned. If the civilian employee violates the written service agreement, including failure to report for duty at the new PDS, any Government funds spent for NTS become the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility.

An official designated by the Service or Agency must 03/01/2025 5F-59 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B determine, on a case-by-case basis, that the location is a designated isolated PDS to authorize NTS of HHG. A civilian employee assigned to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS is not allowed NTS of HHG when available housing at the PDS can accommodate the HHG, adequate housing is available within daily commuting distance, or when it is for the civilian employee\u2019s convenience. An AO may subsequently approve NTS for a PCS to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS for the conversion of HHG in SIT to NTS or the conversion of storage at personal expense to that at Government expense. An eligible civilian employee or new appointee may be authorized subsequent NTS to have an HHG portion transported to the isolated PDS and the remainder stored at Government expense. 3. Time Limit. NTS at Government expense may be authorized for the duration of the civilian employee\u2019s assignment, but no longer than 3 years at a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS.

NTS of HHG for Moves to and between Areas OCONUS. The conversion of HHG from SIT to NTS at Government expense and from storage at personal expense to NTS at Government expense may be authorized or approved in this paragraph. 1. Eligibility for NTS. At least one of the following must be true for a civilian employee to be eligible for NTS: a. The civilian employee is not authorized to transport HHG to the PDS. b. The civilian employee is unable to use HHG at the PDS. c. Storage is in the Government\u2019s best interest. d.

When HHG is placed in NTS at Government expense, the Transportation Officer storing the HHG must provide one copy of the completed DD Form 1164 (Service Order for Personal Property) and any amendments, with the original warehouse inventory receipt, to both the civilian employee at his or her address OCONUS and the personnel office OCONUS servicing the civilian employee\u2019s PDS. b. The gaining personnel office OCONUS must establish a civilian employee NTS HHG file that is separate from official personnel records and serves as a suspense file for fiscal-year funding and any subsequent HHG transportation. If the civilian employee is reassigned to another PDS OCONUS, the file must be forwarded with the civilian employee\u2019s official personnel records. The gaining personnel office OCONUS also must furnish the fiscal-year fund citation to the Transportation Officer, inform the Transportation Officer if the civilian employee\u2019s NTS authority stops for any reason, and destroy the NTS file within a reasonable time after the civilian employee\u2019s PCS to the CONUS. The forms and procedures used for uniformed Service members may be used for a civilian employee\u2019s NTS as long as those forms and procedures are consistent with provisions in this Chapter. 4. Removing HHG from NTS a. A civilian employee whose HHG is in NTS at Government expense may withdraw all or any portion of the authorized HHG weight allowance from storage as long as the HHG is for a civilian employee or dependent\u2019s use in establishing or enlarging a residence. When a civilian employee\u2019s HHG is in NTS because there is no authority to transport it or he or she cannot use HHG at a PDS OCONUS, then he or she may request to withdraw HHG from NTS and transport it at Government expense if the situation requiring the NTS no longer exists and the civilian employee needs the HHG for either the current tour of duty or because he or she signs a renewal agreement. b.

Storage between School Years. A DoDDS civilian employee separated from the rolls during the summer recess is not authorized NTS of HHG. NTS between school years may be authorized for a DoDDS civilian employee on a school-year basis under all of the following conditions: a. The DoDDS civilian employee is employed at the close of a school year and agrees, in writing, to teach the next school year. If the DoDDS civilian employee does not report for duty at the next school year, then he or she is financially responsible for commercial storage costs (including related 03/01/2025 5F-61 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B services) or value of the storage furnished (including related services) if the HHG was stored in a Government facility. If the employing activity determines that the DoDDS civilian employee\u2019s failure to report for duty was beyond the civilian employee\u2019s control, the civilian employee is not financially responsible for those costs. b.

If it is determined before transportation that the PBP&E may cause a civilian employee to exceed the authorized weight allowance, then instead of being moved as an HHG transportation expense, PBP&E may be moved as an administrative expense under the following conditions: (FTR \u00a7302-7) 1. An official designated by the order-issuing command must review an itemized PBP&E inventory before shipment occurs. 2. The order-issuing command must determine that information furnished confirms that transporting the itemized materials as part of the HHG transportation would exceed the authorized weight allowance. 3. An appropriate official designated by the order-issuing command at the new PDS must review and certify that the items listed in the PBP&E are necessary for the proper performance of the civilian employee\u2019s duties at the new PDS. He or she must also determine that, if these items were not transported to the new PDS, the same or similar items would have to be procured at Government expense for the civilian employee\u2019s use at the new PDS. B. Weight Limitations. The maximum weight allowance for shipment of PBP&E is 2,000 pounds net weight. This limitation is not subject to waiver and is effective May 1, 2014. A civilian employee may exceed the maximum weight limit when returning from OCONUS or executing RAT if a transportation agreement to the location OCONUS was made before May 1, 2014. HHG with PBP&E greater than 2,000 pounds must have been originally shipped at Government expense to the location OCONUS. The Government\u2019s obligation to return HHG with PBP&E is limited to the amount of HHG with PBP&E initially authorized to be shipped OCONUS, including when the amount is greater than 2,000 pounds. Once the civilian employee\u2019s HHG returns to the CONUS, there is no authorization or waiver authority over the maximum weight on a subsequent transportation agreement. C. PBP&E Shipped as an Administrative Expense. When PBP&E is authorized for shipment as an administrative expense, the transportation cost is not chargeable to travel-and-transportation-expense appropriations. Transportation must be by the Actual Expense method in the CONUS and the commuted rate method is not authorized (FTR \u00a7302-7). The PBP&E weight and the administrative appropriation chargeable must be itemized on the documentation used to transport the PBP&E. A constructed weight may be used in unusual instances when it is not practicable or it is impossible to obtain the specific PBP&E weight in Table 5-87. The PBP&E may be returned as an administrative expense to any location, limited to the constructed cost to the civilian employee\u2019s actual residence when a civilian employee is separating from Government service provided the PBP&E were transported to the location OCONUS as an administrative expense (FTR \u00a7302-7).

Amended Value Sale. An \u201cAmended Value Sale\u201d is a home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating civilian employee receives a bona fide offer from a qualified potential buyer before the civilian employee has accepted an appraised value offer from the relocation services company. The relocation services company amends its offer to match the net outside sale price. 2. Appraised Value Sale.

When a tour of duty increases for an area OCONUS, the tour of duty in a currently assigned civilian employee\u2019s service agreement remains unchanged. The increased tour of duty only affects any civilian employee who executes an agreement after the date the increased tour of duty is approved. If a tour of duty decreases, the shorter tour of duty applies to any currently assigned civilian employee whose service agreement provides for a longer tour of duty. K. Modified Tour of Duty Type.

If the civilian employee does not arrive at the new PDS, resigns, or arrives at the new PDS and refuses to perform the mission, he or she is required to repay any PDT allowances that the Government has already reimbursed. The civilian employee also may be indebted to the Government for travel, transportation, and relocation expenses incurred on behalf of a civilian employee under other circumstances in this Chapter (CBCA 3804-RELO, June 24, 2014). The appropriate civilian personnel officer must notify the finance, fiscal, or disbursing officer when a civilian employee violates a service agreement. The appropriate personnel officer must determine if PCS allowances must be repaid before processing a civilian employee\u2019s separation.

C. Transfers to, from, and within the CONUS 1. A service agreement provision for a transfer to, from, or within the CONUS that requires 12 months of service following the effective date of transfer is not voided by either of the following: a. A subsequent transfer within that period, whether at the civilian employee\u2019s request or in the Government\u2019s interest. b. Another service agreement being signed incident to a subsequent transfer. 2. The service agreement\u2019s time limit is waived if the civilian employee fails to comply with the requirement for reasons beyond his or her control for reasons acceptable to the employing Department or Agency. In that case, the civilian employee has no liability. The time limit for each service agreement violated must be waived separately. D. Agreement Violations for a Civilian Employee OCONUS 1. Violation during the First Year of Service under an Initial Service Agreement. A civilian employee OCONUS who leaves Government service for reasons unacceptable to the last assigned Agency before completing 12 months of service under the initial service agreement is financially responsible to the Government for travel and transportation allowances and associated costs for the move to that PDS. These include the travel and transportation allowances for the civilian employee, eligible dependents, HHG (including SIT and NTS) a POV, and a mobile home. Return travel is the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility. A civilian employee who departs from a PDS OCONUS for authorized leave, with or without pay, before the end of the first year of an initial service agreement, and resigns while away for reasons unacceptable to the Agency, is allowed credit for the authorized leave time toward completion of the minimum service requirement (see B-184948, November 18, 1975). The provisions of this paragraph apply to each civilian employee OCONUS. Additional penalties may apply to a DODEA teacher. 2. Violation after 1 year of Service under an Initial Service Agreement.

The civilian employee is authorized certain unused allowances accrued under a prior service agreement under which the civilian employee completed the agreed-upon service period. These include personal transportation and the transportation of dependents and HHG (including SIT) from the PDS where the service requirement was satisfied to the actual residence. When the civilian employee is separated from Government service, he or she may apply his or her unused allowances to return travel. If the amount of the unused allowances is less than the costs to return to the actual residence, the difference is the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility. Although the difference is the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility, the Government may procure and pay for the transportation, but must collect the difference from the civilian employee. If the amount of the unused allowances is greater than or equal to the costs to return to the actual residence, the Government may procure and pay for the transportation in full. The civilian employee may choose to pay the total costs and submit a reimbursement claim for the applicable amount. Additional penalties for DODEA teachers may apply. c.

At that point, the Government\u2019s obligation is fulfilled. 2. Civilian Employee\u2019s Obligation. When it is determined insufficient travel and transportation allowances exist to cover travel costs for the full distance from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence, the civilian employee is financially responsible for the costs to the actual residence that are greater than the civilian employee\u2019s allowances. The civilian employee may provide the transportation and be reimbursed for whatever amount the Government would have paid upon submission of an appropriate voucher and receipts for claimed expenses. The civilian employee is authorized Government transportation, if available, from the area OCONUS to the port of debarkation, or beyond; however, collections for excess costs should be made before the travel begins, if required by finance regulations.

The individuals identified in Table 6-2 or Table 6-3 may order or authorize a Service member or dependents to vacate Government-owned, Government- controlled, privatized, or private-sector housing for a limited period and obtain lodging in the local area due to a local emergency displacement. A Service member may continue to report to the permanent duty station or an alternate location in the local area. The local per diem rate is paid in accordance with the percentages and time limits specified in par. 060205, Table 6-17. 060102. Identifying Evacuees A. Service Member. When an evacuation is ordered or authorized, a Service member is placed on a temporary duty (TDY) order or permanent change of station (PCS) order rather than placed in an evacuation status when required to leave a permanent duty station (PDS). A Service member who remains in the local area of the PDS receives local travel only and is not authorized per diem except when evacuation is due to a localized emergency. When ordered or authorized to relocate due to a localized emergency as specified in par. 060101-C, local per diem is paid in accordance with the percentages and time limits specified in par. 060205, Table 6-17, unless the Service member is in receipt of TLA Special (TLA-S). A Service member on a TDY order to a location when evacuation is ordered or authorized will remain on the TDY order and evacuate to the specified location or return to PDS. B. Civilian Employee. When an evacuation is ordered, a civilian employee can be evacuated, placed on a TDY order, or reassigned to a new PDS to a location outside the local area of the PDS. C. Service Member\u2019s Dependent. Other than as specified in par. 060101-C, if a Service member is ordered to remain at the PDS with receipt of TLA-S and his or her dependents also remain, then the Service member\u2019s dependents are not eligible for evacuation allowances. D. Eligibility. Table 6-4 identifies individuals who may be eligible to receive evacuation allowances when the designated Service or Agency in Table 6-2 or Table 6-3 orders or authorizes an evacuation. 03/01/2025 6-3 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B Table 6-4.

Choosing an Evacuation Destination The anticipated duration of the evacuation is critical to determining whether a dependent travels to a safe haven or a designated place. A safe haven is a temporary location to which a dependent is sent. If the conditions causing an evacuation are expected to improve and it is anticipated that the dependent will be able to return to the PDS, then the dependent is evacuated to a safe haven. The safe haven and the evacuated area may be in the same city or country or may be in different cities or countries. A designated place is a location where a dependent will establish a permanent residence. If conditions are not expected to improve, then the dependent is evacuated to a designated place. The appropriate official determines whether an evacuee will go to a safe haven or a designated place. A. Eligibility. The Government may provide evacuation allowances for a Service member\u2019s dependent, civilian employee, or a civilian employee\u2019s dependent when they evacuate to an authorized location selected by the authority in Table 6-2 or Table 6-3.

Approval from the Secretary Concerned is not required when the evacuation authority in Table 6-2 authorizes a non-foreign location OCONUS as the safe haven. C. Alternate Safe Haven. Requests for permission for an evacuee to move from one safe haven to an alternate safe haven must be processed as described in Table 6-7.
