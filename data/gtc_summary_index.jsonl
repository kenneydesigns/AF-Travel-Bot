Commanders and/or Supervisors should ensure Agency Program Coordinators (APCs) provide monthly reports identifying GTCC delinquencies, personal use, misuse, abuse, or fraud. Some examples of misuse uncovered by Inspector General (IG) audits include using the GTCC to pay for adult entertainment, gambling, any expenses for other than the cardholder (except for authorized expenses for dependents when on PCS, permanent duty-related travel, or authorized designated child care provider transportation expenses as outlined in JTR section 050108), and excessive Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals for amounts exceeding authorized meals and incidental expense amounts. Particular attention should be focused on those cardholders with a history of previously reported personal use, misuse, abuse, or fraud. Commanders/Supervisors/APCs should strongly consider temporarily blocking from use or restricting card active start and end dates for both standard and restricted accounts when not in an official travel status for cardholders with a history of misuse (including delinquency). APCs should immediately report any additional GTCC personal use, misuse, abuse, or fraud to the Commander or Supervisor. Commanders or Supervisors should consider whether available personnel assistance programs or corrective action would be beneficial when GTCC personal misuse, abuse, or fraud is identified related to gambling, financial or other concerns. B. Military personnel who violate the specific prohibitions contained in Section 041005 can be prosecuted under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for failure to obey a lawful order or regulation, as well as any other applicable article of the UCMJ, based on the nature of the misconduct involved.

The intent of this policy is to ensure that management emphasis is given to the importance of supervisors carefully considering all of the facts and circumstances in reaching a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair.

Components must advise the DTMO of any additional administrative or disciplinary action against civilian personnel for personal use, misuse, abuse, or fraud of the GTCC or any recommended legislation your Component considers necessary to effectively take disciplinary action against DoD civilian employees for improper, fraudulent, or abusive use of GTCC.

The \u201cDepartment of Defense Government Charge Card Guidebook for Establishing and Managing Purchase, Travel, and Fuel Card Programs,\u201d October 1, 2017, defines the following terms related to improper use of GTCCs: Misuse \u2013 Unintentional use of a government-issued charge card in violation of applicable regulations. These actions are the result of ignorance, carelessness, or both while lacking intent. Abuse \u2013 Intentional or willful misuse of the government-issued charge card in violation of applicable regulations. Willful misuse of the GTCC by DoD personnel (military or civilian) may constitute a crime punishable under Federal (Title 18, U.S. Code) or State law. Internal Fraud \u2013 Any felonious (criminal) act of corruption or attempt to cheat the Government or corrupt the Government\u2019s agents by cardholders or charge card program officials. Internal fraud is the use of the charge card to transact business that is not sanctioned, not authorized, not in one\u2019s official Government capacity, not for the purpose for which the card was issued, or not as part of official Government business. External Fraud \u2013 Any transaction that the cardholder claims was not authorized by them on their GTCC.

Therefore, the approving official will maintain a satisfactory recordkeeping system to track the submission and receipt of travel vouchers. For example, the approving office must annotate on travel vouchers *Blue text with dotted underline denotes new or updated guidance 27 Government Travel Charge Card Regulations Revised April 9, 2025 received by mail the date when the office received the voucher. Travel vouchers submitted electronically to the approving official are considered to have been received on the submission date indicated on the email, or the next business day if submitted after normal working hours.

A travel voucher with an omission or an error will be returned to the traveler within a seven-day period. The notification will include the reason(s) why the travel voucher is incorrect. Receipt of a corrected travel voucher by the paying office restarts the 30-day payment period in which the government must make payment or pay a late fee. C. Late Payment Fees and Charges. Should payment of the travel settlement take longer than 30 days following receipt by the office where the voucher is approved, that office may be required to pay a late payment fee to the traveler. This fee is payable using the Prompt Payment Act interest rate, beginning on the 31st day after submitting a proper travel voucher and ending on the date the government disburses the payment. The only exception to the requirement for this payment is that no payments are required for amounts less than $1.00. Interest payment funding instructions are in the DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR), Volume 10, Chapter 7. The Internal Revenue Service has determined that the late payment fee is reportable as interest and that the payment equal to the late payment charge will be reported as additional wages. In addition, travelers may be reimbursed for late fees imposed by the GTCC vendor if the non- payment that incurred the late fee was a result of the government\u2019s untimely processing of the travel voucher.

Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of the undisputed amount stated on the monthly billing statement by the due date indicated on the statement regardless of the status of their travel reimbursements.

Cardholders are responsible for reconciling their GTCC account against claimed travel expenses, taking action to avoid erroneous or improper payments, and minimizing credit balances on their account. B. Long Term Travel. For travel greater than 45 days, the traveler will file interim vouchers every 30 days in order to receive partial payments and will use split disbursement as the means of settlement to ensure payment to the GTCC vendor to avoid delinquency. For DTS travel, cardholders must request scheduled partial payments when completing their authorization to ensure expenses anticipated to be charged on the GTCC are properly designated. C. Disputed Charges. In the event that the billing statement includes charges that the account holder considers questionable, the cardholder will first contact the merchant to try to resolve the questionable charge. If unsuccessful, the cardholder will access the EAS to view their bill and dispute it online (see 040303). If the cardholder or CBA manager is unable to dispute the transaction online, they may obtain, complete, and submit a dispute form from the APC or GTCC vendor; however, an online dispute is the preferred process. The cardholder or CBA Manager will complete and send the form to the GTCC vendor. The cardholder can find a Transaction Dispute Guide on the GTCC vendor\u2019s website, under APC Guides. All disputes must be filed within 60 days of the date on the billing statement on which the erroneous charge first appeared. It is the responsibility of the cardholder to ensure the dispute form has been received by the GTCC vendor. Once the dispute notification has been received by the GTCC vendor, the GTCC vendor will issue a provisional credit for the amount of the dispute pending resolution. Formally disputed charges will not age and the account will not suspend for lack of payment, however any undisputed charges should be paid in full. Any disputed charge identified in the reconciliation process will be resolved in the manner prescribed in the GSA SmartPay Master Contract. Should the GTCC vendor request additional information to research and resolve the dispute, the cardholder must provide the requested information within the timeframe given. Disputes found in favor of the merchant vendor or failure to comply will result in the disputed charge being placed back onto the cardholders account, and the cardholder would be responsible for repayment as well as any applicable late fees for IBA or Prompt Payment Interest charges for CBA. *Blue text with dotted underline denotes new or updated guidance 29 Government Travel Charge Card Regulations Revised April 9, 2025", "metrics": {"readability": 0.5057, "grammar": 0.7, "keyword_coverage": 0.0, "confidence": 0.6}}
